                            <p>Paul Dufoe was the middle son of Joseph Dufoe and Mary Simpson-Dufoe, and one of twelve children.  
                              Joseph Dufond / Dufoe / Dufault, was born in 1823, son of Nicolas Dufond and mother was Agatha Jawbone [sometimes written Jeanveau] 
                              (descendants of Antoine Nijkiwiwisens) Joseph had married Mary Simpson in Chapeau in 1852. She was the daughter of 
                              Jeanette Robinson & Alexander Simpson [a Scottish man who abandoned them and went back to Scotland] Mary Simpson was born in 
                              Red River District in 1839. She identified herself as Scottish decent and Joseph identified as French. Mary's mother however, 
                              Jean Portelance born in 1805 in Red River, identifies as First Nation. 
                              <a href="#" class="image right"><img src="../../Images/horses.jpg" alt="logging camp image" /></a> 
                              Mary and Joseph, their four oldest children John (1855) Joseph (1857), 
                              Mary (1858) William (1859) and Jean Portelance/Mary Simpson were all registered in the 1861 census as living in a log home in Rapides-des-Joachims. 
                              Their neighbours at the time included Benjamin Sweezy's family, Frederick Ferris' family, and the Holt-Colton family that ran the best hotel in town. 
                              Staying in that hotel and recorded in the 1861 census was Duncan Sinclair the man in charge of the surveying of Aberdeen and Aberford Townships which included 
                              the mouth of the Dumoine and upriver to Grande Chute.
                              Since 1858, the townships on the Upper Canada side of Rapides-des-Joachims were being surveyed for settlement as well as a new road to link Pembroke to Mattawa. 
                              The steamer Pontiac from Pembroke was arriving daily, and the Rapides-des-Joachims and the local timber slide and tote road was very busy. It must have felt like 
                              the area was going through a boom to friends Benjamin Sweezy and Joseph Dufoe (spelt Dufort in 1861 census). Benjamin was the first to move. 
                              <a href="#" class="image left"><img src="../../Images/loggers.jpeg" alt="Square timber bench camp an old image from the logging era" /></a>
                              <p></p>
                              <span class="date"><strong>1871 Census</strong></span>
                              <p>This is the first census of the new Confederation of Canada. On the Dumoine River several Algonquin and European settlers are enumerated (the one and only 
                                time Dumoine is enumerated separately from Aberdeen Township) including Benjamin Sweezy and his family who are running a farm, stopping place and shoemakers shop at the mouth.
                                Many a Dumoine logger must have bought or repaired his Clog Boots at Sweezy's Shop while staying overnight. 
                                I believe Sweezy would have started this operation by salvaging the remains of the groundwork done by Ryan, HBCo and all those that used the site previously. 
                                Sweezy was the ICO agent for the Dumoine Boom at the mouth. Given the advanced development of his farm, shop and services by 1871, I believe he started his operation circa 1867.
                              In 1871 Joseph and Mary Dufoe are still living in Rapides-des-Joachims, which has more than doubled in population. Mary and Joseph added Oliver (1861), Paul (1864), 
                                Benjamin (1866) Cecelia (1867) and Sophia (1868) it the population. A 61-year-old Scottish widow named Jane Robinson (born 1810) is living with them. This is Jean Portelance Joseph 
                                in all other censuses identifies himself as a laborer but in 1871 he calls himself a stonemason suggesting he specialized in foundations, chimneys, piers etc.
                              By 1875 Benjamin Sweezy had developed business interests further upriver at Rocher Capitaine. His father Aaron and three other teenage relatives from New Brunswick, 
                                likely nephews of Benjamins, were running a tavern in Rapides-des-Joachims likely financed by Benjamin.
                                It's not known when exactly he sold or leased the Dumoine Mouth Stopping Place to Joseph Dufoe but there is a clue in the next census.</p>

                                <span class="date"><strong>How big was the Sweezy/Dufoe Farm?</strong></span>
                              <p>The 1871 (the only census that recorded this) Sweezy owned 400 acres, 300 were occupied, 50 improved and 1 was a garden. They produced annually 100 bushels of barley, 20 of peas, 200 of potatoes, 23 tons of hay and 300 cord of wood with butter and fish also sold. 
      
                                Aside from his living quarters and livestock stables Sweezy had established a shoemaker's shop employing 2 people and it was making a reasonable income. When combined with overnight accommodations meals and stable fees for travellers, boom agent and other contracts the operation was profitable  
                                
                                The Sweezy's then an expanded workforce of Dufoes (minus the shoemaker) could make a reasonable living at the Dumoine Mouth Stopping Place. 
                                <a href="#" class="image right"><img src="../../Images/chef.jpg" alt="Historic cooking along the dumoine" /></a> 
      
                                In 1875 Sweezy applied unsuccessfully to have a post office at his place. The postmaster refused siting the facts that Rockcliffe post office was less than two miles away and in the winter mail was sent directly to the lumber camps by sleigh or dog team courier. 
      
                                So the date the Dufoes took over Dumoine River Mouth was between 1876 and 1880. 
          
                                By 1878 a steamboat The Kippawa ran daily trips from Taits Landing at the top of Rapides-des-Joachims to Rocher Capitaine portage with stops along the way anywhere a signal flag flew indicating freight, mail, or passengers to board. The Dufoes Stopping place featured a dock built by ICO for the boom operations and would have been a frequent stop. In the winter an ice road for sleighs was marked along the Quebec shore to Swisha and another less safe one crossed to Rockcliffe. </p>
                              <span class="date"><strong>1881 Census</strong></span>
                                <p>Joseph and Mary and their eleven children are recorded as living in four shanties. They have added Maggie (1874) and Mariah (1879) to the family (the daughter Mary died young, circa 1864). 
                                  Sons Joseph, John, Oliver, Paul, William, and Benjamin are all between 15-26 and are registered as labourers. This is an impressive workforce and a clue that Joseph has bought the Sweezy 
                                  operation, and his family is running it as a diversified farm, stopping place, and lumber service operation.</p>
                              <span class="date"><strong>1891 Census</strong></span>
                                  <p>This is a turning point in the Dufoe Stopping place. Paul is registered as head of the family and recorded as a Hotel/Innkeeper, suggesting she ran the operation. Living there was his wife, an Irish bride named Amistisie, three years younger than Paul, his father (57), mother (53), brother Benjamin (23), sisters Maggie (16) and Maria (10) …and 95-year-old Jane Robinson/Portelance/Simpson. 
                                      Oliver has become a shantyman and the other brothers and sisters have moved back to Swisha. Cecelia's husband Joseph Bertrand is registered as a shantyman. The other brothers are recorded as labourers which could have been any work on the rivers, in the village or likely taking multiple steamboat rides to assist Paul during planting and harvest season and summer visits to the grandparents. They each had 4-5 children, a large workforce. 
                                      Paul and Amistisie never have children. Joseph Sr. dies around 1897 and is buried across the Ottawa River at Stonecliffe. Mary moves to Swisha and dies there a few years later. She is buried in the St Anne Cemetery in Rapides-des-Joachims. 
                                    <a href="#" class="image left"><img src="../../Images/potvins.jpeg" alt="Potvin Farm Stopping Place" /></a> 
                                    The railroad had arrived at Moor Station and Rockcliffe in 1890.This marked the beginning of the arrival of Big City Sportsmen from New England and Montreal who were going to private hunting and fishing leases up the Dumoine, Bear Creek, Fildegrand and throughout the Pontiac. Some of those “Sports” would take the ferry across the Ottawa from Rockcliffe [Stonecliffe] ferry over and maybe stay at Dufoes or walk to their camps up the tote road. 
                                    Paul and Amistisie I believe did quite well at the Dumoine Mouth Stopping place and expanded their operations.
                                    Sometime around 1895-1900, Paul Dufoe bought the Hawkesbury Farm Depot, now known as the Dumoine Rod and Gun Club Lodge. The lumber operations had moved  north of Lac Dumoine by then. The busiest Dumoine tote road began at Swisha and went north to Rettys/Bouchers Stopping place then east to the Noire and west to the Dumoine. The split was at km 22 on todays road near Triple R outfitters, and a chain of Stopping Places extended every ten miles from Swisha to Lac Dumoine Depot. The Hawkesbury lumber company was selling off its limits and farms and the Dumoine location must have been cheap.  
                                    But I guess it was just a little too far away for Paul to operate and he sold it to Swisha residents Odeal and Adelard Sauve circa 1900.</p>

                            </header>
                            <p>Paul invested in a second stopping place at the mouth of the Fildegrand with his sister Cecilia and her husband Joseph Bertrand. Joseph, previously a shantyman, knew the site and the needs of the shantymen, river drivers and teamsters that were his customers. 
      
                              Joseph Bertrand and Mary (Cecilia) are identified as Innkeepers in this census. They have five children Pearl (1890), John (1892) Gladys (1894) William (1897) Gertrude (1899). Joseph Bertrand identifies his father as being from France and mother from the USA. 
                              
                              I believe based on what evidence remains at the mouth of the Fildegrand site on the new Dumoine tote road trail, this stopping place was a big one with a large bunk house and stable and operated into the 1940s. 
                              
                              But a rowdy teamster stopping place on a wilderness road was probably no place to raise a family. Cecelia and her family moved back to Swisha before 1911 for school and a social life. Joseph Bertrand may have worked at the stopping place seasonally or he and Paul figured out how to run it with employees. It would have been connected to the big WEC EDWARDS camp on Six Mile Lake, Paul Dufoes, the local fire towers and Rapides-des-Joachims ORFPAL office by telephone lines from 1914-1950. 
                            </p>
                            <span class="date"><strong>1911 Census</strong></span>
                            <p>Paul and Amistisie are still registered as farmers in Aberdeen Township but at 74 and 71 they must have retired. They have no relatives but four labourers registered below their name are identified as Lumber Depot or River Boom labourers so they could have been staying and working the Dufoe Stopping place.  
      
                              Benjamin Dufoe is recorded as a River Boom man, which means he could have moved the Dumoine Boom from the family farm at the mouth to Pembroke or Boom Creek below Swisha. 
                              
                              The First World War was starting and attracting young men into the service. In 1902 a metal bridge across two islands in the middle of the Rapides-des-Joachims linking the road from the Moore Station to Swisha replaced an unreliable old wooden one at the foot of the rapids. 
                              
                              In 1914 the lumber companies and the Government of Quebec funded a limited company that was to look after the protection of the most valuable timber. ORFPAL, The Ottawa Forest Protection Association Limited went to work establishing a major headquarters in Rapides-des-Joachims and a new neighbour for Paul Dufoe. The Dumoine River was divided into a north and south sector. Eight fire towers were built in the watershed along with eight ranger's cabins and four equipment Depots. The head ranger's station was built above the high water mark and Paul Dufoes 400-acre farm. The foundation still exists today. The company and its rangers kept all the toe roads and portages open to access fighting a fire as soon as it was spotted from the firepower. Steel telephone lines strung through white insulators attached to tree trunks connected all the towers cabins depots lumber camps and fishing camps in the watershed. Anyone could be conscripted to fight a large fire. 
                              
                              Hector Meilleur was the head ranger stationed at the cabin at the mouth in 1945. It was also the end of a mile portage down the tote road around Poplar Rapids which existed before the dam. </p>

                            <p>In 1918 the founding members of the Dumoine Club Lease hiked in from Dufoes up the tote road to survey a large territory and apply for a private club lease. 
                              It was granted for the area of about ten miles northeast and west of the Fildegrand River all the way to Grande Chute. They built their first lean-to cabin on 
                              Robinson Lake with 7 more cabins to follow on Robinson, Cullin, Green and Stevens. Until the 1940s they hiked into these cabins via the Dumoine Tote Road stopping 
                              at Dufoes, Bertrand's and a third farm they called Main Camp (also known as Potvin's Farm). By 1940, using their personal vehicles became more reasonable from Swisha. </p>
                              <p>The Potvin site 3 miles from Bertrands and 2 miles from the lumber camp on Robinson was a secondary stopping place for overflow. I'm sure the business from the 
                                Dumoine Club that adopted it as Main Camp or Headquarters from 1918-1930 kept Potvin Stopping place going. I believe ORFPAL kept the tote road and stopping places 
                                operating from about 1920 to 1960. In 1960 the log drives were stopped on the Dumoine, and trucks were used to move the logs from the Dumoine to the Ottawa River. 
                                The last Ottawa River log drive was 1999. ORFPAL ceased local operations in 1968 when forest ranger patrols and fire towers were replaced by air patrols. </p>
                                <span class="date"><strong>1921 Census</strong></span>
                              <p>Paul Dufoe now 84 and Amistisie now 81 are still registered as farmers so the stopping place depot must have been a life to their liking. 
                                They must be retired there with labourers or families running the place. Brother Benjamin Dufoe dies in 1925, age 90. Joseph Bertrand dies in 1930, age 74, 
                                two years after his son William at age 25. They and many more pioneers of this area are buried in St Anne cemetery in Rapides-des-Joachims. Paul and 
                                Amistisie Dufoe are not buried there. Where is their final resting spot…underwater? </p>
