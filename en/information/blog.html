                    <p>The ancestors of today's Algonquins were well-established in the Dumoine River valley and the surrounding area on both sides of the Quebec-Ontario border by the 
                      time Europeans arrived in Canada, and the expansion and settlement of these lands in the 18th and 19th century encroached on the traditional lands of the Algonquin 
                      as well as many other First Nations communities. In their article, the writers at Canada's History take a look at the traditional territory in the Ottawa Valley and the ongoing issues 
                      surrounding the lack of a land-sharing Treaty for the area.</p>

                          <h2>A TRIBUTE TO BILL MASON</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>Bill Mason always sketched and/or painted while he canoed through his favourite wilderness areas including the Dumoine Valley. He would always distinguish, 
                          in terms of gear and selection of canoe partners, between a slow trip to paint and a whitewater expedition for exploration. I was fortunate enough to paddle 
                          with him on several whitewater trips including his first Dumoine trip in 1974. </p>
                        <span class="image left">
                          <img src="../../Images/art3.jpg" alt="Dumoine Rock in Light and Shade, a painting by Bill Mason" />
                          <figcaption class="intextCaption">Dumoine Rock in Light and Shade by Bill Mason</figcaption>
                        </span>
                        <p>He returned to the Dumoine watershed several times but only painted one scene he specifically titled <strong>DUMOINE ROCK IN LIGHT AND SHADE</strong>. I 
                          believe this is the rock on the west shore of the first major rapid below Lac Benoit.</p>
                        <p>Bill was an amazing blend of talent and energy. Aside from his dedication to painting, film and canoeing he was a tireless defender of wilderness 
                          conservation and a motivator of people to get them out into the wilderness safely. His theory was: 
                          <strong>"<i>If you can get people to fall in love with wild places they will defend (with their voice, money and vote) its preservation</i>"</strong>.
                          I believe this as well, that the creation of the website SENTIER-DUMOINE.CA is another step in that direction. 
                        <p>Bill was a dedicated Friend of Rivers. We formed Friends of Dumoine twenty eight years after his death but I know he would have been a strong voice in 
                          support of our goals of conservation and interpretation of the Dumoine Valley and getting more self propelled users travelling its water, snow and land 
                          trails respectably.</p>

                        <p>This next painting is a self portrait Bill did of himself running The Natch on the Petawawa River in his beloved Red Chestnut Prospector. This timeless 
                          picture is exactly how I remember Bill; skilled, enthusiastic, adventurous, a link between the past and the future and an artist that could capture the 
                          essence of the canoe and moving water.</p>

                          <p><i>The Grande Chute Timber Slide</i></p>
                        </header>

                        <p>In 1871 the longest timber slide in the world was built around Grande Chute on the Dumoine River 1.Today you can still trace the remnants of this structure. 
                          Here is a guide to walking the Timber slide trail.</p>

                        <h3>BACKGROUND HISTORY</h3>
                        The progression of logging operations up the Dumoine Valley was made possible by three essential infrastructure steps:
                        <ol>
                        <li>Creating a reliable way to get supplies up to the shanty camps</li>
                        <li>Creating a quicker way to get the logs to market</li>
                        <li>Adapting to changes in markets </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>STEP ONE</h3>
                        <p>Three decades after Philemon Wright first piloted and sold a raft of Ottawa River timber to British merchants in Quebec City (The raft 'Colombo',1806), cutting 
                          timber began one hundred miles upriver at the mouth of the Dumoine.</p>
                        <p>In 1840 the first step in getting supplies to the lower Dumoine shanty camps was taken by Roderick Ryan and John Egan. Ryan, after cutting timber at the mouth 
                          of the Dumoine for a couple of years, built a four mile road from his crude supply base at the mouth of the Dumoine, to his next timber lease upriver. The road 
                          was used to haul supplies by sleigh and wagon into his camps near Ryan's Chute. John Egan extended the road another three miles to the junction of the Dumoine 
                          and Fildegrand, then up the Fildegrand where he had logging operations.</p>
                        <p>In the mid 1840s, Egan had shanty camps along what was then called 'The West Branch' of the Dumoine. By the 1850s these roads were extended to Six Mile Lake on 
                          the West Branch and to Grande Chute on the Dumoine.</p>
                        <p><i>It was estimated it took three pounds of supplies, to power horse and man, to support operations for cutting every board foot of lumber taken out of the 
                          Dumoine forests.</i></p>

                        <h3>STEP TWO</h3>
                        <p>The first market for Dumoine lumber was in Britain and the very best giant Red and White Pines were cut, squared and rafted to the port of Quebec. Right where 
                          they fell these forty foot logs were squared to fit more efficiently inside the hulls of the British sailing ships. It was a long journey from the Dumoine to 
                          Quebec. It began with the ice breakup in April after the December to March winter cutting season. It ended in June when they were delivered to timber merchants 
                          at Quebec to honour a contract signed the previous year. The individual logs were 'coaxed' over falls and rapids down the Dumoine to the Ottawa River by log 
                          driving specialists, then assembled into large rafts. Smaller crews guided by experienced pilots lived on the rafts, moved slowly by wind, oars and the current, 
                          down the Ottawa and St Lawrence. It was a journey punctuated by periods of dangerous action. The rafts had to be taken apart and the single logs floated through 
                          the rapids on the Ottawa and then reassembled below.</p>
                        <p>If a company was late to market and the ships were either full or had left, then the logging company often went bankrupt. </p>
                        <p>In 1829 a project to hasten the Ottawa River raft trip began. A successful experiment to adapt the single stick slide Ruggles Wright had observed in 
                          Scandinavia was introduced. A 'Canadian size timber slide' was built by the Wrights on the Wrightstown side of Chaudiere Falls. This began the process of 
                          building of a chain of private timber slides at each rapid on the Ottawa. These slides allowed the large timber rafts to be built in sections ( 20' x 40+' 
                          cubes of logs) called cribs. These cribs could bypass the rapids by being navigated down the slides then  reassembled into the giant rafts, thus saving a great 
                          amount of time, damage and loss of logs.</p>
                        <p>The closest Ottawa River timber crib slide to the Dumoine was located seven miles below the mouth at Rapides des Joachims. It was completed in 1844 when all 
                          the slides were built or taken over and improved by the government to ensure equal access and quality. These Ottawa River slides, when combined with several 
                          'improvements' constructed along the Dumoine and Fildegrand, made square timber logging economically feasible on the   Dumoine as high as Lac Dumoine by 1855.</p>

                        <h3>STEP THREE</h3>
                        <p>The last squared timbers raft was taken to Quebec City in 1908 by J R Booth. The squared timber era on the Dumoine spanned approximately four decades (1840-
                          1880) but two changes in the lumber market allowed the lumber companies to prosper by cutting different size trees higher up the Dumoine watershed.</p>
                        <p>The growth of cities in the United States created a great demand for sawn lumber. In 1854 a treaty was signed permitting Canada (still a British Colony) to 
                          export lumber duty free to the United States. This created a rush for buying and building saw mills at Chaudiere Falls lot sites being sold by the government. 
                          This prompted the creation of a new industrial complex there of mills, lumber yards, labourers' homes, and railroad and barge transportation networks in the 
                          late 1850-1870. At the peak of the saw log era in the 1880s these mills were producing 424 million board feet of lumber annually.</p>
                        <p>Many of the sixteen foot saw logs that supplied these mills came from the Dumoine Valley. A sixteen foot log was much easier to cut, haul, river drive and pull 
                          by steamboat down (in booms vs rafts) to these mills. The saw log era allowed lumber companies to operate profitably, cutting logs well above Lac Dumoine, 
                          anywhere water routes allowed logs to be floated to the Dumoine watershed. J R Booth even dug his own canal to link one of his Dumoine Timber limits to the 
                          watershed. Both J R Booth and E B Eddy had unassembled Alligator Boats delivered in the winter by sleigh to their depot on Lac Dumoine. They were used for 
                          towing log booms to the start of Long Rapids on the Dumoine River. You can see the remains of these boats on Lac Laforge today.</p>
                        <p>The final adaptation to the loggers' forest options occurred with the invention of making paper from pulp logs. This process used inferior shorter length and 
                          diameter logs of softwood and hardwood species. These could be harvested from the poorer quality trees passed over in the 1800s because they were unsuitable for 
                          lumber.</p>
                        <p>By 1900 the demand for newsprint in the United States convinced mill owners at Chaudiere, led by E B Eddy and J R Booth, to convert to making newsprint using 
                          pulp logs. Thus the cutting and river drive practices on the Dumoine changed again. The small pulp logs did not need the protection a timber slide offered the 
                          bigger more valuable saw and squared logs. So the lumber companies did not pay the duty fees charged to use the timber slide.The Dumoine slide was slowly 
                          abandoned, and probably disassembled to salvage some timber, in the 1920s.</p>
                        <p>By 1960 the process of moving the logs had switched to hauling by truck. The last river drive occurred on the Dumoine in the spring of 1961 and on the Ottawa 
                          in 1990.</p>

                        <h4>THE Ka-ishpa-kog Boweetig /High Falls/Grande Chute TIMBER FLUME</h4>
                        <p>On a Dumoine canoe trip from Lac Dumoine to the Ottawa River, there are seven portages around significant drops and another hundred plus rapids to negotiate. </p>
                        <p><i>There were even more for the log drivers. Two kilometres of whitewater known as Poplar Rapids was the last challenge leading to a massive log boom at the 
                          mouth of the Dumoine. The Poplar Rapids, below Ryan's Chute, have been drowned out by water backed up behind the dam at Rapides-des-Joachims since 1950.</i></p>
                        <p>Wing dams, flat dams, water level control dams, piers  and retaining booms were all river improvement structures built along the Dumoine and Fildegrand to keep 
                          the logs moving into the main current. But none of these minor log traffic control structures would do the job at the biggest and most dangerous river obstacle 
                          on the river.</p>
                        <p>The fifty foot drop, known as Grande Chute in French, High Falls in English and Ka-ishpa-kog in Algonquin, consists of a thirty foot drop over the first 300 
                          metres then  another ten vertical feet of decent over the four more chutes confined within a kilometre of steep granite shoreline. Grande Chute was costly on 
                          logs lost or damaged and dangerous for the men asked to keep the logs moving. The drops often created a logjam requiring the river drivers to demonstrate great 
                          skill and bravado to break up the tangled logs.</p>
                        <p>A company called The Dumoine Boom and Slide Company (a cooperative of all the lumber companies using the Dumoine to drive logs) built all the first river drive 
                          improvements and roads between 1840 and 1860. By 1860 the Government Department of Public Works took over managing the Ottawa River Slides and all tributary 
                          improvements under the guidance of Horace Merrill.</p>
                        <p>The first timber flume at Grande Chute was a 300 foot version that was built along the west shore bypassing Grande Chutes first drop. The second version was a 
                          3334 foot flume built through the woods parallel to the shore coming out just before the last drop in the Grande Chute series. It reentered the river just above 
                          a campsite we've named Ankose, an Algonquin word meaning 'all things are connected'.</p>
                        <p><i>NOTE: A slide was the name for the large Ottawa River structures built wide enough to accommodate the 20 foot wide timber cribs. A Flume was a structure of 
                          varying width built to carry individual logs around a difficult drop on a tributary of the Ottawa but the term slide was used more often to describe the large 
                          Dumoine and Coulonge Slides.</i></p>
                        <p>There was no bridge across Grand Chute until 1890-1900. I have not been able to find any photos of the original bridge or flume except for one from the Dumoine 
                          Club archives and one I took in 2010 (<i>just before it was destroyed during the construction of a new bridge</i>). </p>

                          <h2>PART TWO: A THREE HOUR WALKING TOUR YOU CAN TAKE TO DISCOVER THE REMNANTS OF THE GRANDE CHUTE FLUME</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>Begin your walk by standing in the middle of today's Grande Chute bridge. This bridge is supported by two massive steel beams. It is the third version of the 
                          bridge I have seen since 1969. The first one in the 1960's was located ten metres further upriver built upon the original cribs assembled here. I believe the 
                          first bridge was built by the Hawkesbury Lumber Company and supervised by their famous foremen Billy Vaughan, circa 1900. It may have crossed from the east 
                          shore to the island you see upriver and back to the west shore built on top of the original flumes entrance cribs. It only had to support wagons and sleighs.</p>
                        <p>The Hawkesbury Lumber Company maintained a large depot five kilometres upriver from Grande Chute from the 1860s to approximately 1910. It was sold, along with 
                          several timber limits, to the E B Eddy Company. The now decayed and disappeared site was known as Rowanton and operated up to 1968 when its last owners, the 
                          Eagle Lumber Company, abandoned it after a fire. Its post office building was bought and moved to the Dumoine Club site upriver. The other salvageable buildings 
                          were taken apart and rebuilt as camps in the area.</p>
                        <p>This one hundred year old depot site today is connected to Grande Chute by the road going northeast and uphill from the east side of the bridge. This road, 
                          however, was a secondary trail before the bridge was built. The main route to the depot was up a road along the west shore to a narrows called Lacasse Point 
                          where the current was suitable for a winter sleigh ice road and a summer crossing by boat or horse.</p>
                        <p><strong>Horace Merrill</strong>, the man who built the most dams, slides and booms on the Ottawa River, <strong>took on the task of supervising the building 
                          of the longest slide in the world (3384 ft) at Grande Chute in 1872</strong>. Merrill was the Superintendent of Public Works for the Ottawa River from 1849 to 
                          1875 and among hundreds of projects he supervised, eleven were in the Dumoine watershed.</p>
                        <p>The winning tender to build the slide for $14,005 (the equivalent of $300,000 in 2022) was awarded to William Davis on July 10,1871.The slide was started 
                          during the low water season and completed by June 1872.</p>
                        <p>The first slide master was 44 year old Hugh Grant. During the four month log driving season (April to July) he would have commuted from Rowanton. He was paid 
                          $2/day to collect a toll of 15 cents per piece for each red or white pine floated down the slide. There would have been tens of thousands of logs floated down 
                          the slide during the peak years 1871-1900.</p>
                        <p>Hugh Grant`s family and five other families (twenty adults and children) were recorded in the 1871 census as living at the Hawkesbury Depot. The tradesmen 
                          included Hugh Grant (timber agent), David West (bookkeeper), William Hutchinson (farmer),  Thomas Mosgrove (blacksmith) and Joseph Labelle (hotel keeper 
                          (stopping place)).</p>
                        <p>In 1906 the government surveyor J E Girard completed a detailed survey of the road from the Ottawa River at Rapides-des-Joachims to Rivière du Moine and to the 
                          Rivière Noire as far as Lac St Patrick. He included a detailed sketch of the Hawkesbury Depot and the bridge and glissoire (slide) at Grande Chute. His sketch 
                          seems to show the bridge was a walking bridge likely built to control water levels with log booms.</p>
                        <p>The first flume entrance consisted of two rock-filled cribs near the west shore, one supporting either side of a 12' wide slide. The slide's flat bottom was 
                          made of large pine planks called deals (measured at 12'x2.5”x10”) .The water level of the entrance was controlled by a cofferdam shutting of water from flowing 
                          into the east side of an island just upriver from the falls diverting it into the west timber slide channel or vice versa during construction of the slide. In 
                          1969 I observed some of the planks that formed this dam  standing up vertically anchored to the bottom with rocks. I imagine the first bridge would have 
                          incorporated a link from each shore to this island, but I don't know this for a fact. </p>
                        <p>If you are looking upstream, or better yet if you walk to the canoe portage landing to look, you can see the remains of the rock cribs that framed the entrance 
                          to the slide. </p>
                        <p>Now look downriver. The slide would have gone under the bridge and indeed in low water you can see one of the huge spikes that held the base of the slide to 
                          the granite island below the bridge. Imagine two men drilling the hole for this spike one holding a drill bit and turning it a quarter turn after every blow by 
                          a sledge hammer swung by his trusted partner until a 6' deep hole was cut into the rock. Obviously the water had to be diverted away from the drilling site by a 
                          control dam to build the slide. There are several of these spikes all along the west shore visible in low water. These would have held the base of the original 
                          1850s slide that bypassed the first drop you are viewing from the bridge.</p>
                        <p>Now look closely along the left/west shore and you will see a small cove between two granite rocks. That's where the 1871 timer slide was engineered to detour 
                          into the forest. It proceeded 3000 feet to the bottom of the Grand Chute series of rapids. The original slide was taken apart and the materials used to form 
                          this new detour slide. Let's walk down the trail for five minutes to a point you can descend into a canal shaped depression that held the 1871 slide. We only 
                          found its start in the cove by tracing the route with metal detectors. There are hundreds of 6-18” spikes along the route of the inland slide. We traced with 
                          our detectors the spikes upriver to the previously mentioned cove. Try to walk along some of this first part of the 1871 detour now flagged (<i>careful here: 
                            the footing is difficult</i>), to understand the difficulty of engineering and building a proper slide with a gradient to hold enough water to float logs.</p>
                        <p>The base of the slide was a series of large cross braces that held the calked flat planks that retained enough  water to keep the logs moving. There is no 
                          known picture of the Dumoine inland slide but several pictures from similar slides built in Algonquin or on the neighbouring Coulonge or Bear Rivers give you a 
                          good idea what this slide looked like. Remember the slide was only used in April/May when the water was at its peak and there was lots of volume to divert into 
                          the slide.</p>
                        <p>At a point down the hiking trail just before the campsite called Bellevue we indicate where the slide went inland. You can see a series of old logs that 
                          formed the base. There is an obvious route the slide took to a point 2000 feet further along. Here, where it was directed back 500 feet to the river, the 
                          terrain is very rough. The construction of the base must have been very difficult.</p>
                        <p>In low water from the viewpoint at Bellevue Camp you can see an unnatural pile of rocks in the canyon at the foot of the falls. These were the rocks that were 
                          contained in the crib that held the base of the end of the 1850 first edition of the slide.</p>
                        <p>How did they build these cribs? Most often the cribs were built onshore in the winter, manoeuvred into place on the ice, filled with rocks by hand then the ice 
                          below was cut away and they would settle into place. In very low water I scrambled along the west shore between the cove and this crib. At about 20 foot 
                          intervals, there are the huge spikes drilled into the granite shoreline that held the first timer slide. I know labour was cheap in 1850, about $1.00 per day, 
                          but still the degree of difficulty of working conditions to construct these timber flumes is mind numbing.</p>
                        <p>You can follow the flagged trail of the inland timber slide or walk on the easier river portage trail to the exit point of the slide above Ankose Camp.</p>
                        <p>We will be creating a point of interest sign at this point where the inland slide returns to the river. Jammed against a large boulder the log flume exit 
                          entered a small bay above the last chute and rapids leading to a holding pond below. A pointer boat and men with pike poles or peaveys would be posted here to 
                          make sure the logs headed out into the current. They were assisted in this task by a four foot high wing dam that was built out to the end of a granite point 
                          that is part of today's campsite. You can see a series of four large spikes in the rock that held the base of this wing dam. Three of them are bent, speaking to 
                          the force of the spring water filled with logs that pressed against the dam.</p>
                        <p>Imagine what that force would do to a man! Many a pair of boots were hung on a cross or tree on the Dumoine as a simple loggers tribute to their fellow workers 
                          that drowned. It was an acceptable practice to exchange your boots for the hanging pair if the hanging pair were in better shape.</p>
                        <p>The portage and the wild river ride for the logs ends at a beautiful pond. We have created a campsite here called <i>Timber brand</i>. Each of the saw logs was 
                          stamped with the owners brand to allow companies to claim their logs to keep them moving. There is an old crosscut saw placed at this campsite that the 
                          Rapides-des-Joachims youth group has painted with eight of the most popular Dumoine Timber Brands. If you're extremely lucky you might find a dead head or 
                          beached log today with an old brand on the end or side.</p>

                        <h3>EXIT</h3>
                        <p><i>You can continue down the hiking trail to Robinson Lake or return back to Grande Chute by the upper canoe portage trail created in the 1980s or the original 
                          river portage trail created eons ago by the Anishinabeg families that lived here and other first nation traders on their way to and from the Kichi Sibi.</i></p>

                            </header>
                            <p>Paul Dufoe was the middle son of Joseph Dufoe and Mary Simpson-Dufoe, and one of twelve children.  
                              Joseph Dufond / Dufoe / Dufault, was born in 1823, son of Nicolas Dufond and mother was Agatha Jawbone [sometimes written Jeanveau] 
                              (descendants of Antoine Nijkiwiwisens) Joseph had married Mary Simpson in Chapeau in 1852. She was the daughter of 
                              Jeanette Robinson & Alexander Simpson [a Scottish man who abandoned them and went back to Scotland] Mary Simpson was born in 
                              Red River District in 1839. She identified herself as Scottish decent and Joseph identified as French. Mary's mother however, 
                              Jean Portelance born in 1805 in Red River, identifies as First Nation. 
                              <a href="#" class="image right"><img src="../../Images/horses.jpg" alt="logging camp image" /></a> 
                              Mary and Joseph, their four oldest children John (1855) Joseph (1857), 
                              Mary (1858) William (1859) and Jean Portelance/Mary Simpson were all registered in the 1861 census as living in a log home in Rapides-des-Joachims. 
                              Their neighbours at the time included Benjamin Sweezy's family, Frederick Ferris' family, and the Holt-Colton family that ran the best hotel in town. 
                              Staying in that hotel and recorded in the 1861 census was Duncan Sinclair the man in charge of the surveying of Aberdeen and Aberford Townships which included 
                              the mouth of the Dumoine and upriver to Grande Chute.
                              Since 1858, the townships on the Upper Canada side of Rapides-des-Joachims were being surveyed for settlement as well as a new road to link Pembroke to Mattawa. 
                              The steamer Pontiac from Pembroke was arriving daily, and the Rapides-des-Joachims and the local timber slide and tote road was very busy. It must have felt like 
                              the area was going through a boom to friends Benjamin Sweezy and Joseph Dufoe (spelt Dufort in 1861 census). Benjamin was the first to move. 
                              <a href="#" class="image left"><img src="../../Images/loggers.jpeg" alt="Square timber bench camp an old image from the logging era" /></a>
                              <p></p>
                              <span class="date"><strong>1871 Census</strong></span>
                              <p>This is the first census of the new Confederation of Canada. On the Dumoine River several Algonquin and European settlers are enumerated (the one and only 
                                time Dumoine is enumerated separately from Aberdeen Township) including Benjamin Sweezy and his family who are running a farm, stopping place and shoemakers shop at the mouth.
                                Many a Dumoine logger must have bought or repaired his Clog Boots at Sweezy's Shop while staying overnight. 
                                I believe Sweezy would have started this operation by salvaging the remains of the groundwork done by Ryan, HBCo and all those that used the site previously. 
                                Sweezy was the ICO agent for the Dumoine Boom at the mouth. Given the advanced development of his farm, shop and services by 1871, I believe he started his operation circa 1867.
                              In 1871 Joseph and Mary Dufoe are still living in Rapides-des-Joachims, which has more than doubled in population. Mary and Joseph added Oliver (1861), Paul (1864), 
                                Benjamin (1866) Cecelia (1867) and Sophia (1868) it the population. A 61-year-old Scottish widow named Jane Robinson (born 1810) is living with them. This is Jean Portelance Joseph 
                                in all other censuses identifies himself as a laborer but in 1871 he calls himself a stonemason suggesting he specialized in foundations, chimneys, piers etc.
                              By 1875 Benjamin Sweezy had developed business interests further upriver at Rocher Capitaine. His father Aaron and three other teenage relatives from New Brunswick, 
                                likely nephews of Benjamins, were running a tavern in Rapides-des-Joachims likely financed by Benjamin.
                                It's not known when exactly he sold or leased the Dumoine Mouth Stopping Place to Joseph Dufoe but there is a clue in the next census.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <span class="date"><strong>How big was the Sweezy/Dufoe Farm?</strong></span>
                              <p>The 1871 (the only census that recorded this) Sweezy owned 400 acres, 300 were occupied, 50 improved and 1 was a garden. They produced annually 100 bushels of barley, 20 of peas, 200 of potatoes, 23 tons of hay and 300 cord of wood with butter and fish also sold. 
      
                                Aside from his living quarters and livestock stables Sweezy had established a shoemaker's shop employing 2 people and it was making a reasonable income. When combined with overnight accommodations meals and stable fees for travellers, boom agent and other contracts the operation was profitable  
                                
                                The Sweezy's then an expanded workforce of Dufoes (minus the shoemaker) could make a reasonable living at the Dumoine Mouth Stopping Place. 
                                <a href="#" class="image right"><img src="../../Images/chef.jpg" alt="Historic cooking along the dumoine" /></a> 
      
                                In 1875 Sweezy applied unsuccessfully to have a post office at his place. The postmaster refused siting the facts that Rockcliffe post office was less than two miles away and in the winter mail was sent directly to the lumber camps by sleigh or dog team courier. 
      
                                So the date the Dufoes took over Dumoine River Mouth was between 1876 and 1880. 
          
                                By 1878 a steamboat The Kippawa ran daily trips from Taits Landing at the top of Rapides-des-Joachims to Rocher Capitaine portage with stops along the way anywhere a signal flag flew indicating freight, mail, or passengers to board. The Dufoes Stopping place featured a dock built by ICO for the boom operations and would have been a frequent stop. In the winter an ice road for sleighs was marked along the Quebec shore to Swisha and another less safe one crossed to Rockcliffe. </p>
                              <span class="date"><strong>1881 Census</strong></span>
                                <p>Joseph and Mary and their eleven children are recorded as living in four shanties. They have added Maggie (1874) and Mariah (1879) to the family (the daughter Mary died young, circa 1864). 
                                  Sons Joseph, John, Oliver, Paul, William, and Benjamin are all between 15-26 and are registered as labourers. This is an impressive workforce and a clue that Joseph has bought the Sweezy 
                                  operation, and his family is running it as a diversified farm, stopping place, and lumber service operation.</p>
                              <span class="date"><strong>1891 Census</strong></span>
                                  <p>This is a turning point in the Dufoe Stopping place. Paul is registered as head of the family and recorded as a Hotel/Innkeeper, suggesting she ran the operation. Living there was his wife, an Irish bride named Amistisie, three years younger than Paul, his father (57), mother (53), brother Benjamin (23), sisters Maggie (16) and Maria (10) …and 95-year-old Jane Robinson/Portelance/Simpson. 
                                      Oliver has become a shantyman and the other brothers and sisters have moved back to Swisha. Cecelia's husband Joseph Bertrand is registered as a shantyman. The other brothers are recorded as labourers which could have been any work on the rivers, in the village or likely taking multiple steamboat rides to assist Paul during planting and harvest season and summer visits to the grandparents. They each had 4-5 children, a large workforce. 
                                      Paul and Amistisie never have children. Joseph Sr. dies around 1897 and is buried across the Ottawa River at Stonecliffe. Mary moves to Swisha and dies there a few years later. She is buried in the St Anne Cemetery in Rapides-des-Joachims. 
                                    <a href="#" class="image left"><img src="../../Images/potvins.jpeg" alt="Potvin Farm Stopping Place" /></a> 
                                    The railroad had arrived at Moor Station and Rockcliffe in 1890.This marked the beginning of the arrival of Big City Sportsmen from New England and Montreal who were going to private hunting and fishing leases up the Dumoine, Bear Creek, Fildegrand and throughout the Pontiac. Some of those “Sports” would take the ferry across the Ottawa from Rockcliffe [Stonecliffe] ferry over and maybe stay at Dufoes or walk to their camps up the tote road. 
                                    Paul and Amistisie I believe did quite well at the Dumoine Mouth Stopping place and expanded their operations.
                                    Sometime around 1895-1900, Paul Dufoe bought the Hawkesbury Farm Depot, now known as the Dumoine Rod and Gun Club Lodge. The lumber operations had moved  north of Lac Dumoine by then. The busiest Dumoine tote road began at Swisha and went north to Rettys/Bouchers Stopping place then east to the Noire and west to the Dumoine. The split was at km 22 on todays road near Triple R outfitters, and a chain of Stopping Places extended every ten miles from Swisha to Lac Dumoine Depot. The Hawkesbury lumber company was selling off its limits and farms and the Dumoine location must have been cheap.  
                                    But I guess it was just a little too far away for Paul to operate and he sold it to Swisha residents Odeal and Adelard Sauve circa 1900.</p>

                            </header>
                            <p>Paul invested in a second stopping place at the mouth of the Fildegrand with his sister Cecilia and her husband Joseph Bertrand. Joseph, previously a shantyman, knew the site and the needs of the shantymen, river drivers and teamsters that were his customers. 
      
                              Joseph Bertrand and Mary (Cecilia) are identified as Innkeepers in this census. They have five children Pearl (1890), John (1892) Gladys (1894) William (1897) Gertrude (1899). Joseph Bertrand identifies his father as being from France and mother from the USA. 
                              
                              I believe based on what evidence remains at the mouth of the Fildegrand site on the new Dumoine tote road trail, this stopping place was a big one with a large bunk house and stable and operated into the 1940s. 
                              
                              But a rowdy teamster stopping place on a wilderness road was probably no place to raise a family. Cecelia and her family moved back to Swisha before 1911 for school and a social life. Joseph Bertrand may have worked at the stopping place seasonally or he and Paul figured out how to run it with employees. It would have been connected to the big WEC EDWARDS camp on Six Mile Lake, Paul Dufoes, the local fire towers and Rapides-des-Joachims ORFPAL office by telephone lines from 1914-1950.

                            <span class="date"><strong>1911 Census</strong></span>
                            <p>Paul and Amistisie are still registered as farmers in Aberdeen Township but at 74 and 71 they must have retired. They have no relatives but four labourers registered below their name are identified as Lumber Depot or River Boom labourers so they could have been staying and working the Dufoe Stopping place.  
      
                              Benjamin Dufoe is recorded as a River Boom man, which means he could have moved the Dumoine Boom from the family farm at the mouth to Pembroke or Boom Creek below Swisha. 
                              
                              The First World War was starting and attracting young men into the service. In 1902 a metal bridge across two islands in the middle of the Rapides-des-Joachims linking the road from the Moore Station to Swisha replaced an unreliable old wooden one at the foot of the rapids. 
                              
                              In 1914 the lumber companies and the Government of Quebec funded a limited company that was to look after the protection of the most valuable timber. ORFPAL, The Ottawa Forest Protection Association Limited went to work establishing a major headquarters in Rapides-des-Joachims and a new neighbour for Paul Dufoe. The Dumoine River was divided into a north and south sector. Eight fire towers were built in the watershed along with eight ranger's cabins and four equipment Depots. The head ranger's station was built above the high water mark and Paul Dufoes 400-acre farm. The foundation still exists today. The company and its rangers kept all the toe roads and portages open to access fighting a fire as soon as it was spotted from the firepower. Steel telephone lines strung through white insulators attached to tree trunks connected all the towers cabins depots lumber camps and fishing camps in the watershed. Anyone could be conscripted to fight a large fire. 
                              
                              Hector Meilleur was the head ranger stationed at the cabin at the mouth in 1945. It was also the end of a mile portage down the tote road around Poplar Rapids which existed before the dam. </p>

                            </header>
                            <p>In 1918 the founding members of the Dumoine Club Lease hiked in from Dufoes up the tote road to survey a large territory and apply for a private club lease. 
                              It was granted for the area of about ten miles northeast and west of the Fildegrand River all the way to Grande Chute. They built their first lean-to cabin on 
                              Robinson Lake with 7 more cabins to follow on Robinson, Cullin, Green and Stevens. Until the 1940s they hiked into these cabins via the Dumoine Tote Road stopping 
                              at Dufoes, Bertrand's and a third farm they called Main Camp (also known as Potvin's Farm). By 1940, using their personal vehicles became more reasonable from Swisha. </p>
                              <p>The Potvin site 3 miles from Bertrands and 2 miles from the lumber camp on Robinson was a secondary stopping place for overflow. I'm sure the business from the 
                                Dumoine Club that adopted it as Main Camp or Headquarters from 1918-1930 kept Potvin Stopping place going. I believe ORFPAL kept the tote road and stopping places 
                                operating from about 1920 to 1960. In 1960 the log drives were stopped on the Dumoine, and trucks were used to move the logs from the Dumoine to the Ottawa River. 
                                The last Ottawa River log drive was 1999. ORFPAL ceased local operations in 1968 when forest ranger patrols and fire towers were replaced by air patrols. </p>
                                <span class="date"><strong>1921 Census</strong></span>
                              <p>Paul Dufoe now 84 and Amistisie now 81 are still registered as farmers so the stopping place depot must have been a life to their liking. 
                                They must be retired there with labourers or families running the place. Brother Benjamin Dufoe dies in 1925, age 90. Joseph Bertrand dies in 1930, age 74, 
                                two years after his son William at age 25. They and many more pioneers of this area are buried in St Anne cemetery in Rapides-des-Joachims. Paul and 
                                Amistisie Dufoe are not buried there. Where is their final resting spot…underwater? </p>
