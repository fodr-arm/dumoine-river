                    <h3>Trail description</h3>
                    <p>
                      The Dumoine tote road trail is unique in Canada as it combines hiking along a protected wild river, over historic Anishnabee 
                      portage trails and a follows a recreated loggers road built 150 years ago.You will be walking through beautiful old growth 
                      forests with lush undergrowth, wildlife sounds, signs and sitings and camping at old log drive campsites. You may choose to 
                      day trip from campsites accessible by boat in the south and car in the north or do the full twenty-six kilometre hike through 
                      from either end. This trail is very flat with only a 75m elevation range across the entire 26 kilometers, but a full elevation
                      profile is available to view if you'd like. This is a wilderness hike with no services other than primitive campsites, no cell phone reception and no 
                      trail staff other than volunteers. It is well blazed and continues to evolve into one of the great hikes through nature and 
                      history. This website is your best source for up to date information.

                    <h3>How to use the Interactive Web Map</h3>
                    <p><i>Note: this map was designed to be used on desktop; 
                      not all features are available on mobile.</i></p>
                    <p>
                    <p>
                      The interactive web map is the perfect way to get acquainted with the Dumoine Tote Road Trail before you 
                      begin your adventure. It offers the chance to get a feel for the terrain, natural landmarks, campsites, 
                      access points and more to ease the planning process. 
                      </i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once you open the map, use your mouse's scroll to zoom in and out and click and drag the map to pan around.
                      If you prefer, you can also use the zoom buttons located in the top-right corner of the map. There is also
                      a scale bar in the lower portion of the map.
                    </p>
                    <p>The campsite information panel on the side provides details about every site along the trail: if you click
                      on a campsite name in the list, the map will zoom to that site on the map for you. Similarly, if you click on a campsite
                      icon on the map, the matching listing will be highlighted in the informational side panel (you may have to scroll through 
                      the listings to find it).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>All features on the map are interactive:</strong> <ul>
                        <li>hover over a campsite icon to learn its name</li>
                        <li>hover over a side trail, point of interest or boat launch to get more information</li>
                        <li>click on a yellow-highlighted trail segment to learn about its historical significance</li>
                        <li>click on the highlighted road segments to get more details about driving directions to the trailhead</li>
                        <li>click on a bright orange shape to learn about historical stopping places</li>
                        <li>right-click, hold and drag the map to change the perspective of the view</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      Lastly, the legend is available to you to toggle layers on and off. If you would only like to see campsites, simply uncheck the boxes
                      for all other layers in the legend and they will disappear from the map. To make them reappear, check the box in the legend again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Happy exploring!</strong>

                    <p>
                      There are several outfitters offering a shuttle service to either the northern trailhead on Chemin
                      Dumoine or the southern trailhead on the Ottawa River. It is highly recommended that you rely on a shuttle service
                      because the roads to the northern trailhead are rough and not suitable for many vehicles. 
                      A detailed list of recommended outfitters and guides is available.

                    <p>
                      The northern trailhead is accessible via logging roads in Zec Dumoine by entering through the town of 
                      Rapides-des-Joachims, QC. Follow Chemin Dumoine for 13 kilometers, then take a left at the fork to
                      stay on Chemin Dumoine for 13 more kilometers. The trailhead will be on your left after you cross
                      the bridge at Grande Chutes. Please note that the roads are rough and there is limited parking
                      on the side of the road at the trailhead.

                  <h3>Evacuation Times</h3>
                  <p>The first southern five kilometres from the Ottawa River to Ryans Chute are accessible by power boat and 
                    an evacuation could be made that way back to the launch sites listed on the Ontario side (3 hours).</p>
                  <p>Similarly, the first five northern kilometres of the trail are near a Zec Dumoine gravel road suitable for trucks, ATVs and SUVs. 
                      It is a 46 km drive (2 hours) to the nearest hospital in Deep River, Ontario.</p>
                  <p>The sixteen kilometres between these two exit options is a zone where you would have to be evacuated by canoe, ATV or by helicopter. 
                      First responders will have a time-consuming and difficult time reaching and evacuating you to a place where a boat, vehicle or helicopter could reach you (12-24 hours).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When you purchase a road, parking and trail permit from Zec Dumoine it includes the search and rescue support from Air Medic. 
                    Air Medic would initiate a plan for your rescue which could involve helicopter, bush road vehicle and/or boat rescue. 
                    They would coordinate with their search and rescue partners in the area to execute a plan.
                    <strong>They need to know your location, either using a GPS point or the nearest trail marker, so please pay attention to these markers.</strong>

                  <h3>Police</h3>
                  <p>If it is a police matter, you are in Quebec so it is a Sûreté du Quebec (not OPP) jurisdictional matter. The closest base is in Campbells Bay 
                    which is a 1hr40min drive to Rapides des Joachims: dial 911 or for non-emergency dial 819-648-5689.</p>
                  <h3>Forest fire</h3>
                  <p>If you see a forest fire try to get upwind of it into a clearing or ideally to a lake/river shoreline. Use wet clothing, blankets as a defence. 
                    Self-evacuate as soon as possible and call 911.</p>
                  <h3>Conservation Officer</h3>
                  <p>If you observe unusual aggressive animal behaviour or someone breaking conservative laws report it to the Zec Dumoine office.</p>
                  <h3>Emergency Phone Numbers</h3>
                  <p>You should always leave your wilderness travel itinerary with a friend at home and check with them at the start and end of your trip. Aside from this, 
                    carry (in a waterproof notebook with your communication device) your emergency health, emergency contact person and insurance information and the following phone numbers:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Your shuttle driver's cell or home phone number</li>
                      <li>ZEC Dumoine: 1 (613)-586-1966</li>
                      <li>Deep River Hospital: (613) 584-3333</li>
