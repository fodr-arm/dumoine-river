                    The Dumoine has been an important trade route and meeting place for many First Nation peoples for centuries. 
                    The Ottawa river watershed is the ancestral home of the Algonquin Nation, and the Dumoine was the home of the Dumoine River Families of that nation. This group of 12 families created the first portages and hunting trails in the watershed. 
                    Later, the Dumoine and its surrounding areas would become important to European colonizers as a logging river and fertile valley.

                            Contact with Europeans (Cartier and Basque fishermen) is first made in the Gulf of St Lawrence in the 1500s. Word and trade goods would have reached the powerful Morrison Island family known as The Kitchissippirini not long afterwards. Their Chief ‘Tessouat’ along with other chiefs, meet with Samuel De Champlain at the Gulf in 1603.                      </p>

                            Early French traders recognize the trade potential of the Dumoine on their way to establish a fort on Lac Temiscamingue. Trade and travel are severely interrupted by the Beaver Wars involving the Haudennaussonee (five nation Iroquois) and the Anishnabe and Wyandot/Wendat (Huron) peoples.

                            After the great Peace Treaty signed in Montreal ended the Beaver wars, French merchant Paul Guillet purchases the trade licence for the Ottawa River watershed. He builds a new Fort Temiscamingue at the narrows, where it still exists today, and temporary posts at Grande Lac Victoria, Lac Dumoine and the mouth of the Dumoine. Trade goods are carried to Temiscamingue in the large 36-foot canoes and to the outposts in the smaller 26-foot canoes. The Dumoine families would have seen, traded, built, and even crewed a lot of these canoes.

                            The department of Public Works begins to sell mill rights on Chaudière Island. Within 5 years this revolutionized logging on the Dumoine by changing the type of logs required at the mills from giant squared timber to round 16-foot saw logs. This shortens the river drive for saw logs by three weeks. Square timber would still go to Quebec City until 1900. As consequence, logging expands to the top of Lac Dumoine.

                            The steamer “Kippawa” is launched to link the upper landing at Rapides-des-Joachims to the south end of the Rocher Capitaine Portage Road. Wagons and steamers extended further up the Ottawa River to Mattawa by 1880.

                      <p>
                        In 1858, the townships on the Upper Canada side of Rapides-des-Joachims (in what is now Ontario) were being surveyed for settlement as well as for the construction of a new road to link Pembroke to Mattawa. 
                        Soon afterwards, the steamer “Pontiac” began arriving daily from Pembroke, carrying workers and visitors up the Ottawa River to Rapides-des-Joachims. 
                        The area by the mouth of the Dumoine thrummed with activity as laborers walked up and down the tote road to reach the timber slide and perform other logging related tasks along the river. </p>

                        <p>
                        By 1871, Rapides-des-Joachims had nearly doubled in population, and had grown to be a lively town. One notable resident of the time was Benjamin Sweezy, who, alongside his family, ran a large farm, an overnight stopping spot, and a shoemaker's shop at the mouth of the Dumoine. 
                        Sweezy’s application to host a post office on his property, however, was denied in 1875 by the postmaster general. The Sweezy farm was 400 acres total, and produced 100 bushels of barley, 20 of peas, and 200 of potatoes, as well as 23 tons of hay and 300 cords of wood every year. 
                        Sometime after 1876, Sweezy sold or leased his property and the businesses on it to Joseph Dufoe (born 1823) a laborer who specialized in stonemasonry. Joseph was married to Mary Simposon-Dufoe, and together they had a large family, with 12 children between them. 
                        By 1891, Paul Dufoe (born 1864), their middle child, had taken over operations at the farm and stopping place.

                        Paul Dufoe invested in a second stopping place at the mouth of the Fildegrand river, alongside his sister Cecilia and her husband Joseph Bertrand, who were named innkeepers in the census. 
                        Based on evidence still remaining at the site, the stopping place appeared to be large property, with a big bunk house and stable, and it operated well into the 1940s.

                        In 1890, railroad access had reached the mouth of the Dumoine and with it brought sportsmen from Montreal and New England, who were interested in going to private hunting and fishing leases along the river. 
                        Looking to expand his operations and build new structures to take advantage of this new development, Paul Dufoe bought the Hawkesbury Farm Depot around 1895, but sold it off not soon afterwards, perhaps because it was simply too far away for him to practically operate. 
                        The farm depot is now known as the Dumoine Rod and Gun Club lodge. In 1918, founding members of the club hiked along the tote road to survey a large territory and to apply for a private club lease. 
                        They built their first lean-to cabin on Robinson Lake, soon followed by 7 more. Until the 1940s, they would hike into these cabins via the Dumoine Tote Road, staying at Dufoes, Bertrands and a third farm known as Main Camp, or Potvin’s farm.

                      <p>In the 1900s the forest was patrolled by forest rangers watching for fires from a series of fire towers throughout the Dumoine Valley. 
                        The Tote road became the access route for these rangers and their fire fighting equipment. 
                        Lastly, a new breed of urban sportsmen, keen on the Dumoine hunting and fishing experience, walked up the Dumoine Tote Road to their cabins beginning in 1918.
                        By 1960, air patrols by float planes were used to locate fires. Improved trucks and bush roads all replaced the forest rangers, the river drives and offered an alternative for the walk-in sportsmen. </p>
                      <h4>The Tote Road was then abandoned to nature...Until now.</h4>
